investigate,whether the increase of unesteri-fied fatty acids in the cord blood which takes placeafter a sole glucose infusion inthe mother, could be caused by the low capabilityof glucose utilization

rate ofrise and steady-state polarization; the potential change required for 50%sodium inactivation is +8mv in normal ringer's solution and +16mv in thepresence of 1.0 mm nicl2 (22 c.).  1.0 mm nicl2 increases the time constantof delayed rectification as measured in na-poor solutions at 4 c. by a factorof about 2.  the decrease of action potential under cathodal polarization isslightly delayed by nicl2.  it is concluded that prolongation of the nodalaction potential by nicl2 is due to delayed and reduced inactivation of napermeability and delayed increase of k permeability; part of the nicl2-effectcould be explained by assuming competition between ni++ and ca++ for specificsites at the membrane.\"}}, {'_index': 'medical_02', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 346, '_source': {'medical_doc':

optic agnosia  semeiological and pathogenetic aspectsthe authors discuss the classical concept of agnosia and make a survey ofpathogenetical factors which determine its phenomenology.  the original andtraditional concept of such a term implied the loss of the capacity torecognize objects, when the functions of sense organs are undamaged.  thepsychological studies on perception and the modern physiology ofvision allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception andto affirm their identity.  cortex and recptors are closely bound andfunction in unison.every cortical alteration is thus reflected in sensorial functions; it istherefore that on practical semeiological grounds it is possible to obtain acongruous information of the corresponding cortical functionality through anexploration of sense organs carried out by suitable means.  since we areconfronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluatedynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization andspatialization of stimuli.  such methods are now quite numerous and oftencomplex  a particular stress is laid on local adaptation, flicker fusion, andtachistoscopy on account of their significance and suitability.  by suchmethods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathologicaldisturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology ofvisual recognition.  fluctuation, extinction, alteration in the perception ofmovement, both real and apparent, changes in adaptation to light anddarkness are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which,at the same time, may be of determinant importance for the onset of 'agnosic'behaviour.  the complexity of the latter, on the other hand, cannot alwaysbe explained by sensorial disturbances only  other mechanisms, with a functioncomplementary but not less indispensable to the dynamics of perceptiveprocesses, may intervene and interfere in it.  on the basis of the latestneurophysiological data the attention is called to ocular motility andproprioceptivity, centrifugal innervation of sensorial receptors, andvestibular afferences.  a particular clinico-pathogenetical significance isattached by the authors to the association of lateral visual disturbances withaltered proprioceptive and kinesthetic information from the correspondinghalf-body  such association in fact is nearly always present among the factorsresponsible for the most strictly 'spatial' errors of 'agnosic' pathology.  inthe light of these pathogenetical considerations as

related to changes of the visual function and of itscomplementary mechanisms; (b) cases in which hemianopia is associated witha homolateral deficit of somatic proprioceptivity; (c) cases in which

of long surviving animals have posed many questionsregarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprineand diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  allanimals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapycan be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneysapparently are protected in some way in the new environment because asecond donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantationof a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decreasein renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted backto their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for theprolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a doubledose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption ormetabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results becausetwo kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in thesame drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient andthis sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned fromdrugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidneyhomografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejectedwithin 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidneyhomografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from thesame donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidneysurvival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by theproduction of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalizedimmunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.\"}}, {'_index': 'medical_02', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 378, '_source': {'medical_doc':

experiments   not only theiodine-containing radicals with which thecontrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates,diatrizoates, iothalamates,etc.), but also the final salification products appearto be responsible for the widelydivergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrastagents, to the point that differ-ent salts of the same compound behave as entirelydifferent agents both chemicallyand biologically.  the results seem to indicate thedominance of sodium ion and/orthe protective effect of methylglucamine salts withrespect to the myocardial toxi-city of current radiopaque

description of techniques and theirvalidation. ii. effects of respiration. iii. effects ofmuscular exercisea method is described which permitsmeasurement of relative changes in the exter-nal

right ventricular dimen-sions increased, while the opposite occurredduring expiration and during the val-salva manoeuvre.  left ventricular dimensionsexhibited little change during normalrespiration.  during deep, slow inspiration,the changes in dimensions of the leftventricle lagged behind those of the rightventricle by 1 to 5 (generally 2 or 3) car-diac cycles; the magnitude of the changes inthe

probably promotes differentiationof large basophilic cells to smalllymphocytes, resulting in an increased output ofsmall lymphocytes.  in the lymphnodes, thyroxin promotes differentiation of largepyroninophilic cells ('transitionalcells') into immature and mature plasma cells.the effects of thyroxin on dif-ferentiation are followed by an increased growthof the thymo-lymphatic organs,characterized by an increased incidence of largebasophilic cells and increased weightof the lymphatic organs.  growth of the thymus andlymph nodes precedes that ofthe red splenic pulp.  this delayed splenic responseis not due to a transformationof an increased number of immigrated thymiclymphocytes, as neonatal thymectomydoes not prevent the thyroxin-stimulatedoccurrence of large basophilic cells in thered splenic pulp.  the thyroxin-stimulatedgrowth of the lymphatic system is ac-companied by an increased output of largerlymphocytes through the thoracicduct, resulting in an increased number oflarger lymphocytes in the blood.  inpostnatally thymectomized animals, having anormal (or above normal) amount ofcirculating small lymphocytes, thyroxin producesa drastic decrease

between thethymus and peripheral lymphatic tissue.the data are compatible with other indica-tions of rapid cell renewal in the thymus.there is suppression of initial uptake ofh3tdr into the dna of each large lymphocyticprogenitor cell in the thymus, appa-rently because of a feedback of thymidinecontaining material from small lympho-cytes in the thymus.  depletion of the thymusof small cells, as by operative stressor whole body x-ray, leads to a markedincrease in the uptake of h3tdr into thedna of large thymocytes.  this finding,which is in agreement with the previousfindings of sugino et al. suggesting transferof thymine nucleotides from small thy-mus lymphocytes to precursor cells, may ormay not be related to the apparenttransfer of dna label between thymic cells.the evidence for the latter consists ofthe curvilinear dilution of the dna label inthe thymus proliferating cell populationand the relationship between the rate of dnalabel dilution in large cells and thedna in the small cells in the thymus.  afterthe dna label in progenitor cells inthe thymus and lymph nodes has entered thesmall cell population, the subsequentdilution of grains in these dividing cells followsthe same slope as the loss of radio-activity from the entire lymph node.  there is along retention of some h3dna labelin the dividing lymph node cell population.  thissuggests that the loss of radioacti-vity from the dividing cells and from the smallcell population as a whole occurs e-qually.  this pattern prevails regardless ofwhether the percentage of large andsmall cells is altered experimentally.  thesefindings can be explained by an inter-change of the dna nuclear label between smalllymphocytes and large lymphocytes.this could occur by some process such asphagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by trans-formation of the small lymphocyte into a large,dividing cell.  the data fit best withthe latter possibility.  all or any of thesemechanisms would lead to an equilibrationof the dna label between large and smallcells.  this finding prevents the assign-ment of a finite life span to lymphocytes onthe basis of dna labeling kinetics.  ne-vertheless, there appear to be at least twodifferent types of lymphocytes.  one,the 'thymus-type' lymphocyte, is found in thethymus cortex, bone marrow and ger-minal centers of lymphoid follicles.  the othertype, found abundantly in the wide-spread peripheral

ii. bacterial cytoplasmcomparison of the fine structure of thecytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that ofthe 'cell in general' reveals importantdifferences leading to the conclusion that, inthe bacterial cytoplasm, there is littledifferentiation into separate functional en-tities.  there is no nuclear membrane, andfine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo-plasm into the cytoplasm where they mayexpand in all directions.  the cytoplasm is notnecessarily intersected by membranousprofiles of special configuration, as is borneout by e. coli b and other gram-negativeorganisms.  when membranous profilesof special configuration are present, asin the gram-positive b. subtilis, thesedo not appear differentiated into clearlydefinable endoplasmic reticulum, golgisubstance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria.as for kinetosomes, the presenceof centrioles is perhaps not very likely.  theexperiments in which tellurite is re-duced in the cells suggest that there arestructures at the base of the flagella withreductive capacity.  however, upon applicationof the tetranitro-blue tetrazoliumtechnic to b. subtilis, these are not stained.they are presumably identical withbasal granules.  the membranous structuresin b. subtilis are called chondrioidsby the author because probably one of theirfunctions is that they are the sites ofthe respiratory enzyme chain.  in thegram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable siteof the respiratory chain has a structurevery different from that in the bacillus; itis not clear whether membranes areinvolved in their structure.  morphologically,even in b. subtilis chondrioids differfundamentally from the mitochondria in thatthey are not built up from compositemembranes, they are extensions of the plasmamembrane, and they may not be completelyclosed systems.  regarding this lastpoint, it was observed that chondrioids maypossibly stand in open connection withthe cell's environment, since its lumen is notseparated from the cell wall by aplasma membrane.  although as yet nothing isknown about this, it does not seem tobe precluded that these membranous organellesmay function also as intracellulartransport systems.  contrary to porter's ideasabout er, the chondrioids are notextensions of a nuclear envelope, but of theplasma membrane.  on the other hand,they are in the nuclear area, in direct contactwith the nucleoplasm, and therefore,perhaps, they need not carry in their interiorsome dna, as is now becoming knownfor ordinary mitochondria.  the chromatophorevesicle is of a simple structure andin connection with the plasma membrane.  it iscovered by a single membrane andthus resembles the granum disc, but it is muchsmaller.  in tissue cells, an im-portant function of the er is the support of proteinsynthesis by ribosomes boundto their surfaces.  evidence is now accumulatingthat the active complexes for poly-peptide synthesis in bacteria are also membrane-boundand are series of 70s ribo-somes using the same messenger rna molecule.it remains a contradictory situ-ation that the particles obtained here through releaseof cytoplasm from protoplastsin diluted, rather crude fixing media, and identifiedas ribosomes, could not berecognized as such in thin sections of the ryter-kellenbergerfixed protoplasts.this point is much in need of clarification.  buteven if the cytoplasm in the thinsections of the protoplasts is in a state ofdispersion brought about artificially, itis still apparent from the various micrographsthat basically the cytoplasm is anetwork of presumably linear arrays, with manyinterconnections due to fibrillarsystems.  fibrils from the nucleoplasm penetratedeeply into the cytoplasm.  thepresence of fine fibrils of various thicknesses,electron densities, and

withthis exception, statistical studies suggestthat it is the death of a mother in the first7 yr. of a child's life, as opposed to thatof a father, that is potentially an etiologi-cal factor for the future development ofpsychoses, delinquency and psychoneuroses.the case histories of 6 boys who had losttheir fathers were given.  in each instancethere was distinct evidence that the

specific cir-cumstances surrounding the death of the father.in some cases it was the unresolvedgrief reaction in the mother which helped toperpetuate the disorder in the child.  re-solution of this in the mother during therapyled to improvement in the child's func-tioning.  in other instances improvementoccurred especially when the child ceasedto be preoccupied with a close identificationwith the dead father.  those boys whowere involved most closely in their mother'sgrief reactions were the ones who weremost disturbed.  the brief treatment giventhese boys and their mothers appearedto be
